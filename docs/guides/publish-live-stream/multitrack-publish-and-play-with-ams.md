# Multitrack publish and play with AMS

WebRTC multitrack lets us stream multiple audio/video tracks through a single WebRTC connection. In order to use Multitrack feature, the SDP semantic should be set as **Unified Plan** which is also set by default in AMS v2.4.3 and above.

With multitrack streams, you can play different groups of streams with a single broadcast ID. Then, you can start playing those groups of streams with one play request and most importantly through a single WebRTC connection and this decreases resource usage as well.

### Terminologies related to multitrack

**Main track:** Stream Id of a group is referred as main track.  
**Sub track:** The streams in a group with different stream Ids are referred as subtracks.

To combine the broadcasts into a single broadcast (main track), publish the streams as shown below.

* When calling the publish method of the webrtcAdaptor in the SDK, pass the group ID as ```mainTrack```. The URL for the WebRTC sample page will be as follows:

`https://AMS-domain:5443/AppName/?mainTrack=groupID`

* You must use the following URL for RTMP streams:

```rtmp:/AMS-domain:1935/WebRTCAppEE/streamId?mainTrack=groupID```

### Publishing multitrack streams

Let's publish a stream to the sample WebRTCAppEE application with **streamId=video** and group ID (mainTrack) as **main**.

`rtmp:/AMS-domain:1935/WebRTCAppEE/video?mainTrack=main`

Now, as needed, publish streams with different audio subtracks.

Assume you have two audio tracks with the stream IDs **audio1** and **audio2**.

### Playing multitrack streams

Multitrack streams can be played with the sample page, **multitrackplayer.html**

`https://AMS-domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/multitrackplayer.html`

![sample.png](@site/static/img/sample(1).png)

1.  Write the group ID in the text box
2.  Request the sub-tracks by clicking the ```Tracks``` button
3.  Select the tracks you want to play and click the ```Start Playing``` button
4.  If a new subtrack is added to the group, it will be played automatically

You can enable or disable video/audio feed for a sub-track with ```enableTrack(mainTrackId, trackId, enabled)``` methods in the webrtc-adaptor SDK.

## Multitrack conference

**multitrack-conference.html** is a new sample conference page that is compatible with multitrack playback.

The ```mainTrack``` (group ID) will be the same as the room Id. For example, in the above-described case, the mainTrack is **main**, so it will be the room Id.

`https://AMS-domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/multitrack-conference.html`

You can also join the the room in ```playOnly``` mode using following URL.

`https://AMS-domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/multitrack-conference.html?playOnly=true`

The play request for the room Id is only called once in a Multitrack conference.

### Add and Delete subtracks via Rest API

You can use the [add SubTrack Rest API](https://antmedia.io/rest/#/BroadcastRestService/addSubTrack) to add the various subtracks to the main track. Here's the CURL sample:

    curl -X 'POST' 'https://AMS-domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/rest/v2/broadcasts/mainTrackId/subtrack?id=stream1' -H 'accept: application/json'

You can use the [delete SubTrack Rest API](https://antmedia.io/rest/#/BroadcastRestService/removeSubTrack) to delete the various subtracks from the main track. Here's the CURL sample:

    curl -X 'DELETE' 'https://AMS-domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/rest/v2/broadcasts/mainTrackId/subtrack?id=stream1' -H 'accept: application/json'
